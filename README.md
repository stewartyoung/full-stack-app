## The tech stack
* MongoDB database
* Node API 
* Node Web Server (express) 
* React Front End

## Notes
* Node dev dependencies are only required in development, but a different set of dependencies will be required for deployment
* webpack package compiles modules wwith dependencies into static assets, a compiler of sorts (e.g. jsx into js)
* Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. The "@" sytax is a bit like ```from class import class.object```  
```npm i -D babel-loader @babel/cli @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties```
